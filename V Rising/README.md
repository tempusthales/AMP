## [V Rising](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/)


V Rising is a game where you awaken as a vampire. Hunt for blood in nearby settlements to regain your strength and evade the scorching sun to survive. Raise your castle and thrive in an ever-changing open world full of mystery. Gain allies online and conquer the land of the living.


## What is [AMP]()?

AMP by CubeCoders is the easy way to create and manage game server instances from a friendly, intuitive web interface with no complex setup required.


## Install Instructions

Like all other AMP Modules place the .kvp and .json files in your ADS instance under the `/Plugins/ADSModule/GenericTemplates` directory along side the other .kvp and .json files.

Then restart ADS, and your new configuration will appear as an option when you select `Create Instance`.

## How to Configure your server?

Create a new instance and load the V Rising Application from the `Create Instance` option.  Then go to `Configuration` and click on `Host Settings` to configure Host features and `Game Settings` to configure Gameplay features.

## Additional Updates

I will be updating this module with the intention of having most of the Game Settings available from AMP.

## Support
