## Broke Protocol


Broke Protocol is the bastard child of GTA and Minecraft.  It has all the doo hickies GTA has, but in a voxel environment. Weapons, drugs, coffee, etc.


## Install Instructions

Like all other AMP Modules place the .kvp and .json files in your ADS instance under the `/Plugins/ADSModule/GenericTemplates` directory along side the other .kvp and .json files.

Then restart ADS, and your new configuration will appear as an option when you select `Create Instance`.

## How to Configure your server?

Just follow the panels for server settings.

## Support

You can find me in the [**Gaming Hedgefund Discord**] (https://discord.gg/upq2vAWG2G) in channel `#amp-modules` or join **[Cube Coders Discord](https://discord.gg/cubecoders)**, makers of AMP and ask for help in `#generic`.

If you would like to help contribute to the further development of this module, boost the [**Gaming Hedgefund Discord**] (https://discord.gg/upq2vAWG2G)

## Credits

Fellow AMP contributor, **Greenlan#4870** took one for the team: `Greelan: I spent a bit of time in the BP discord. Incredibly toxic community. Not inclined to spend any more time on the template`, and got a brown heart medal.  His effort provides the necessary server files for Linux, but you need AMP running on a Linux server for that. 

My effort will be porting the Server Settings needed to launch the server under Windows, as most of the work was done by Green.  

You are my boi Blue, erm Green, you are my boi.

PS. broke-protocol-linux is the kvp for linux servers and broke-protocol-win is the kvp for windows servers.
