## Longvinter


Longvinter is a game where you can fish, farm, craft, gather, cook, loot or steal from other players and build a campsite or a village with your friends in an open-world multiplayer sandbox game without rules! TL;DR it's Animal Crossing with PvP. 


## Install Instructions

Like all other AMP Modules place the .kvp and .json files in your ADS instance under the `/Plugins/ADSModule/GenericTemplates` directory along side the other .kvp and .json files.

Then restart ADS, and your new configuration will appear as an option when you select `Create Instance`.

## How to Configure your server?

Work in Progress.  This server is still under development.  Feel free to download and contribute, but at your own risk. =)
