## Kingdom of Atham


A multiplayer survival game set in a dark fantasy world that is continuously expanding in the Atham universe. Fight and survive in a sandbox world, build your home, and dominate your enemiesâ€¦ or your friends!


## Install Instructions

Like all other AMP Modules place the .kvp and .json files in your ADS instance under the `/Plugins/ADSModule/GenericTemplates` directory along side the other .kvp and .json files.

Then restart ADS, and your new configuration will appear as an option when you select `Create Instance`.

## Additional Updates

I will be updating this game module as the game itself updates and progresses.
